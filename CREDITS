Walkingdead mod for Minecraft. Requires ForgeModLoader. Walkingdead are zombies that spawn and
attack in the day time or night time. They eat chickens, pigs and YOU!

The walker (zombie) textures are from the JohnSmith Texture Pack v9.7. You can find the pack
here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v97-32x-142/

Some of the textures have been modified for my use in this mod.

Many thanks to JohnSmith for allowing the use of his textures.
