Walkingdead mod for Minecraft. Requires ForgeModLoader. Walkingdead are zombies that spawn and
attack in the daytime. they eat chickens, pigs and YOU!

The walker (zombie) textures are from the JohnSmith Texture Pack v9.7. You can find the pack
here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v97-32x-142/
Many thanks to JohnSmith for allowing me to use these textures.

Some of the textures have been modified for my use in this mod.
